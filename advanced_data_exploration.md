## Learning Goals
- Frame advanced exploratory analyses within the broader big data lifecycle.
- Apply PySpark data abstractions (DataFrames and RDDs) to interrogate large, distributed datasets.
- Design resilient, auditable workflows that survive schema drift, data quality issues, and infrastructure failures.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Designing an Advanced Big Data EDA Workflow

1. **Contextualize the exploration**: Define business questions, success metrics, and constraints (privacy, SLAs, cost). Map each question to required data domains and expected signal strength.
2. **Inventory and profile data assets**: Discover relevant tables, streams, and files across data lake zones (raw, curated, refined). Capture metadata such as volume, update cadence, lineage, and schema history.
3. **Engineer a reproducible sandbox**: Stand up an environment (e.g., PySpark notebooks backed by MinIO storage) with declarative configuration for credentials, dependencies, and compute sizing.
4. **Ingest efficiently**: Use predicate pushdown, partition pruning, and incremental loads to minimize cluster workload. Validate schemas against expectations before promotion to the exploration layer.
5. **Assess data quality at scale**: Implement distributed checks for completeness, uniqueness, referential integrity, statistical drift, and bias. Persist quality metrics for later audits.
6. **Explore across multiple abstraction levels**: Combine DataFrame APIs for relational-style questions with RDDs when you need custom transformations, complex aggregations, or fine control over partitioning.
7. **Synthesize insights and iterate**: Translate findings into dashboards, reports, or prototypes. Gather feedback, refine hypotheses, and back-propagate data issues to upstream owners.
8. **Operationalize learnings**: Package reusable logic into versioned artifacts (functions, SQL views, metrics definitions). Update documentation and schedules within the data lifecycle roadmap.

### RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) in Context
- ![RDD lineage and iteration diagram](https://res.cloudinary.com/dyhjjms8y/image/upload/v1760834116/advanced-eda-rdd-diagram.png)
- **Definition**: RDDs are immutable, partitioned collections of records that Spark distributes across worker nodes. They track lineage, enabling automatic recomputation of lost partitions.
- **Creation Paths**: Load from storage (e.g., Parquet files via `spark.read` followed by `.rdd`), parallelize in-memory collections, or transform existing RDDs/DataFrames.
- **Transformations vs. Actions**: Transformations (e.g., `map`, `filter`, `flatMap`, `reduceByKey`) build a logical DAG without triggering computation. Actions (e.g., `collect`, `count`, `take`, `saveAsTextFile`) execute the DAG.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Lineage graphs allow Spark to rebuild partitions deterministically after executor failures without full data replication.
- **Performance Considerations**: Control partition counts, caching (`persist`/`cache`), and data serialization. Prefer narrow transformations when possible to reduce shuffles.
- **Interoperability with DataFrames**: Use RDDs when you need custom objects, type flexibility, or fine-grained control. Convert back to DataFrames for SQL-friendly operations or when leveraging Catalyst optimizations.

## Hands-on Challenge: PySpark + MinIO Parquet Exploration

### Scenario
You are given two Parquet datasets stored in MinIO that together describe customer transactions:
- `s3a://<bucket>/raw/transactions.parquet`
- `s3a://<bucket>/curated/customers.parquet`

Your goal is to design a reproducible exploration that surfaces high-value customer behavior and flags potential data quality issues.

### Data Model Canvas Continuity
![Data Model Canvas](https://res.cloudinary.com/dyhjjms8y/image/upload/v1760834797/data-model-canvas.png)
- Anchor every analytical decision to the existing Data Model Canvas from the prior module. Treat each box as a stakeholder question your EDA must answer or inform.
- Map raw signals to canvas quadrants:
  - **Problem & Actors**: Validate pain points by quantifying user segments, churn rates, or service tickets. Identify which customers (actors) the MinIO datasets actually cover.
  - **Solution & Actions**: Prototype interventions (e.g., targeted campaigns) by modeling behavior drivers uncovered in the data.
  - **Data & Hypotheses**: Document lineage, availability, and assumptions tested during exploration; update the canvas with new hypotheses or refined expectations.
  - **KPIs & Performance**: Translate profiling metrics into candidate KPIs, noting how they roll up to business impact and what instrumentation is required.
  - **Values, Risks, Impact**: Capture value narratives, compliance risks, and measurable outcomes informed by your findings.
- Deliver a brief appendix summarizing how each canvas block evolved because of the exploration, highlighting gaps that require additional data collection.

### Tasks
1. **Bootstrapping**
   - Configure a Spark session with the appropriate Hadoop AWS connector and MinIO credentials (access key, secret key, endpoint URL, path-style access).
   - Document configuration in code so teammates can reuse it.
2. **Secure Ingestion**
   - Read both Parquet files into DataFrames with schema inference disabled; instead, declare schemas explicitly to guard against drift.
   - Verify object counts and partition structures; log anomalies such as empty partitions or unexpected column types.
3. **Hybrid EDA**
   - Perform initial profiling with DataFrame operations (descriptive statistics, null analysis, distinct counts).
   - Convert the transaction DataFrame to an RDD to implement at least two custom transformations (e.g., time-binning, aggregation by composite keys, anomaly scoring) that highlight the flexibility of the RDD abstraction.
   - Persist intermediate results (`cache`/`persist`) when reused across multiple actions; measure and comment on runtime impact.
4. **Synthesis**
   - Join customer and transaction data, emphasizing partition strategy to minimize shuffles (e.g., broadcast small dimension tables or use repartitioning hints).
   - Produce a ranked list of customer cohorts that drive the majority of revenue along with supporting metrics (count, average ticket, recency).
   - Surface at least three data quality alerts (missing demographic fields, skewed partitions, duplicate transaction IDs) with quantification and recommended remediation paths.
5. **Documentation & Deliverables**
   - Ship a notebook or PySpark script (`advanced_eda_minio.py`) containing code, commentary, and visualizations.
   - Include an architectural sketch illustrating where this exploration sits within the broader data lifecycle (ingest → storage → processing → analysis → activation).
   - Summarize key findings, open questions, and next steps for productionization.

### Evaluation Checklist
- Spark session correctly authenticates against MinIO using secure configuration handling.
- Schemas, partitioning, and caching strategies are explicitly justified.
- RDD usage demonstrates capabilities beyond simple DataFrame queries.
- Insights tie directly to business questions and reference data lifecycle considerations.
- Documentation enables peers to reproduce and extend the exploration.

## Connection to Data Discovery with Data Model Canvas

This **Advanced Exploratory Data Analysis** lesson serves as a fundamental foundation for developing the **Data Discovery with Data Model Canvas** artifact. The objective is to prepare each team to discover and explore relevant data for their respective data domains.

### How this lesson supports the Data Model Canvas:

1. **Data Discovery**: Advanced EDA techniques with PySpark enable teams to efficiently explore large volumes of data, identifying patterns, anomalies, and value opportunities in their specific domains.

2. **Hypothesis Validation**: The exploratory analysis process helps validate or refine initial hypotheses about data, directly contributing to Data Model Canvas components:
   - **Value Proposition**: Insights discovered during EDA ground the value proposition
   - **Data Structure**: Analysis reveals the actual data structure and its relationships
   - **User Profile**: Identified behavior patterns help define user profiles
   - **Use Cases**: Analysis discoveries generate more realistic and data-driven use cases

3. **Artifact Preparation**: This lesson provides the necessary technical tools for each team to:
   - Process large volumes of data from their domain
   - Identify data-driven innovation opportunities
   - Generate insights that support the Data Model Canvas
   - Document discoveries in a structured way

### Next Steps:
After completing this lesson, each team will be prepared to apply the learned techniques to their domain-specific data, generating insights that will directly feed into the Data Model Canvas development in the Week 02 artifact.
