# SI08 - Advanced Data Engineering Module

## Project Overview

**TAPI Project:** Creation of a solution for an application using Natural Language for awareness of the preservation of natural means/resources

**Company:** SKZ Oberle LTDA - Corporate solutions hub with 80+ years of market experience in accounting, financial BPO, and tax consulting.

**Supervising Professor:** Hermano Peixoto

## Project Team

- **Project Leader:** Fabio Oberle (Commercial Director)
- **Technical Leader:** Kaic Fachinetti (Developer)
- **Business Leader:** Ricardo Evangelista (Data Analyst)
- **Executive Leader:** Alexandre Tamura (IT Director)

## Problem Statement

SKZ Oberle lacks a unified and accessible data infrastructure for fast, traceable, and secure access to accounting, tax, and financial information. Data is fragmented across multiple sources (ERP systems, SQL databases, spreadsheets, manual files), hindering analytical solutions and future AI integrations.

## Project Objective

Establish a robust corporate data platform by integrating, organizing, and centralizing accounting, tax, and financial data. Build a structured, secure, and auditable foundation for efficient internal data consumption and future natural language-based AI financial assistant implementation.

## Expected Benefits

- Automated data ingestion from multiple sources (ERPs, SQL databases, spreadsheets)
- Data organization, cleaning, standardization, and enrichment
- Centralized storage in Data Lake or Data Warehouse
- Data availability through APIs, data views, or query tools
- Implementation of security, access control, and traceability policies

## Project Scope

### MVP Deliverable
First version of Big Data pipeline integrating and centralizing SKZ Oberle's main accounting, tax, and financial data with automated ingestion, structured storage, and controlled access.

### Sprint Deliverables
- **Sprint 1:** User understanding and business understanding
- **Sprint 2:** Data ingestion system
